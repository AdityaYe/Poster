  <h1>STOP ANIMAL ABUSE IN CIRCUS</h1>
  <p>Circuses are notorious for their cruel treatment of animals. Wild animals like elephants, lions, and tigers are forced to perform dangerous tricks for human entertainment. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.</p>
  <p>Join us in our fight against animal abuse in circuses. Say no to circuses that use animals, and encourage others to do the same. For more info check: https://www.freedomforanimals.org.uk</p1>
